# Project Title
# Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning

# Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs). The aim is to develop a robust classification model to predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents as true positive (TP), benign positive (BP), or false positive (FP). Using the comprehensive GUIDE dataset, the model will improve the SOCs' ability to prioritize incident responses, reducing false positives and ensuring quicker identification of true threats.

# Business Case
The solution developed in this project has real-world applications in several cybersecurity contexts:

# SOCs Efficiency: 
Automating incident classification helps SOC analysts focus on critical issues.
# Incident Response Automation: 
Guided response systems can use the modelâ€™s output to suggest precise actions for mitigating incidents.
# Threat Intelligence: 
Enhances detection by utilizing historical evidence and customer responses.
# Enterprise Security: 
Reduces false positives, ensuring real threats are identified and handled efficiently, improving the security posture.

# Problem Statement
As a data scientist at Microsoft, your task is to build a machine learning model to classify cybersecurity incidents (TP, BP, FP) using the GUIDE dataset. This model will be used by SOCs to assist in decision-making, ultimately improving enterprise security by providing precise, context-aware recommendations.

You are expected to train the model using train.csv and evaluate its performance on test.csv with metrics like macro-F1 score, precision, and recall.

# Dataset Overview
The GUIDE dataset contains records of cybersecurity incidents. The data hierarchy consists of:

# Evidence: 
Metadata associated with incidents, such as IP addresses and email addresses.
# Alerts: 
Groupings of related evidence indicating potential threats.
# Incidents: 
Aggregation of alerts representing a larger cybersecurity breach.
The dataset contains 45 features with 1M annotated incidents, with triage grades (TP, BP, FP) as the target variable.

# Data Preprocessing Steps:

Handling missing values
Feature engineering (e.g., timestamp transformation)
Encoding categorical variables
Normalization/Standardization of numerical features
Approach
# 1. Data Exploration
Inspect the dataset (train.csv) for feature types and distributions.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify correlations and class imbalances.
# 2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values using imputation or removal.
Engineer new features to enhance model performance.
Encode categorical features (One-Hot, Label Encoding, etc.).
Normalize/standardize numerical features for better model performance.
# 3. Data Splitting
Split the data into training and validation sets (e.g., 80-20 split).
Use stratification to preserve the distribution of the target variable across both sets.
# 4. Model Selection and Training
Begin with a baseline model (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree).
Train advanced models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), and Neural Networks.
Implement cross-validation to ensure consistent model performance.
# 5. Model Evaluation
Use macro-F1 score, precision, and recall to assess model performance.
Tune hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
Address class imbalance with methods like SMOTE or class weighting.
# 6. Model Interpretation
Analyze feature importance using SHAP values or permutation importance.
Conduct error analysis to understand and minimize misclassifications.
# 7. Final Evaluation on Test Set
Evaluate the final model on the test.csv dataset and report performance metrics (macro-F1, precision, recall).
Compare results with baseline performance to ensure model improvement.
